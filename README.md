## ✨ Features

- **🕷️ Web Crawler**  
  Multi-threaded crawler that collects 6,000+ HTML documents, respects robots.txt, and detects duplicates.

- **📑 Indexer**  
  Efficient indexing for fast retrieval and incremental updates.

- **🔍 Query Processor**  
  Supports stemming and phrase search (with quotation marks) for enhanced query matching.

- **⭐ Ranker**  
  Combines TF-IDF relevance with PageRank popularity for optimal result ordering.

- **🖥️ Web Interface**  
  Modern UI with search suggestions, paginated results, snippets, and timing metrics.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

- **Web Crawler:**  
  Starts from seed URLs, collects and normalizes documents, respects robots.txt, employs multi-threading for scalability.

- **Indexer:**  
  Extracts and processes content from HTML, builds efficient data structures for quick query responses, supports incremental updates.

- **Query Processor:**  
  Handles preprocessing, stemming, and advanced query types (including phrase search).

- **Ranker:**  
  Calculates relevance using TF-IDF and popularity with PageRank, combining both for final ranking.

- **Web Interface:**  
  Responsive frontend for user interaction, displays results with titles, URLs, snippets, and supports pagination (10 results/page).

## 💡 Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local address (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
2. Enter your search query. Use quotation marks (`"phrase"`) for exact phrase searches.
3. Browse results, view snippets, and paginate through results.
4. Refine your search using suggestions.
